# Flashcard Application

## Description:
This is my flashcard application, created with MERN. This project is meant for me to study and deploy best web development practices.
To start on your local computer, download the files and run `npm run dev` on both the client and server.

#### Flashcard Application Features
For the project, the Flashcard application allows you to create flash cards that you can use for personal use. You can create your own topic on the front page, and create cards inside the topic. The data created this way is all saved to MongoDb, and can be deleted at any time.

#### Navigating the Application
Starting the application, the user is first greeted by the front page, where you can create topics. Click inside the created topic to explore the cards related to the topic at hand.
